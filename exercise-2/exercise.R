# Exercise 2: Subsetting and Manipulating Vectors

# Create a vector `x` that the numbers 5,2,6,2,1,7


# Create a vector `y` that has the numbers 2,3


# Create a vector `z` by adding (not combining, but adding) `x` and `y` (note the recycling!)


# Create a vector `first.three` that has the first three elements of `z` in it


# Create a vector `small` that has the values of `z` that are less than 5


# Create a vector `large` that has the values of `z` that are greater than or equal to 5


### Bonus ###

# Replace the values in `z` that are larger than 5 with the number 5


# Replace every other value in `z` with the number 0
